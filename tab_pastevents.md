'''Event Agenda: '''<br /><br />
The OWASP Top Ten Proactive Controls 2018<br /> (By: '''Jim Manico''')<br />

Software developers are the foundation of any application. In order to achieve secure software, developers must be supported and helped by the organization they author code for. As software developers author code that makes up a web application, they need to embrace and practice a wide variety of secure coding techniques. The OWASP Top Ten Proactive Controls (2018) is an OWASP documentation project that lists critical security techniques that should be included in every software development project. This document was written by developers for developers to assist those new to secure development.<br />

<br />
Bypassing iOS Security using Enterprise Provisioning Hooks and Enterprise Mobility Management <br /> (By: '''Georgia Weidman''')<br />

This talk demonstrates how features Apple includes in their iOS ecosystem to support corporate enterprise provisioning and management can be used to exploit all iOS devices. We will cover the faculties that Apple includes to allow enterprises and mobile security vendors to remotely provision settings and load applications and how a malicious attacker could take advantage of these vectors.
We will discuss Configuration Profile options with security implications and using the Enterprise Development Program to bypass Apple’s anti-malware app controls. Though Apple considers this a “feature not a bug” and a phishing issue, no anti-phishing training readily available for either consumers or corporations specifically address these phishing attacks. However, according to the Verizon Breach Report over 90% of enterprise compromises came in through endpoints, largely from phishing.
Mobile devices open up a wide range of additional phishing options than the email scenarios. We will demonstrate how penetration testers and red teams can simulate these attacks to raise user awareness and perform impact analysis of a potential breach begun by a compromised iOS device.<br />

<br />
Egypt Cyber and Privacy Security Requirements for Software Developers. <br /> (By: '''Mohamed Alfateh''')<br /><br />
In this session, we will discuss number of Cyber law clauses that should be considered in developing software applications, we will go through the final draft of the executive regulation to highlight the additional controls that should be implemented in the applications, that will add extra layer of security and ensure the compliance with the Cyber law requirements. <br />

'''Event Agenda: '''<br />
Diffusing A Bomb With Reverse Engineering<br /> (By: '''Fady Othman''')<br />

A while ago I stumbled upon an online reverse engineering challenge, I downloaded the challenge and from the beginning it caught my attention. I started reversing and I realized that it was a well designed challenge that is perfect to teach reverse engineering. after solving the challenge I was disappointed when I looked online to see how other people solved it because it was solved in a way that teaches them too little.
In this workshop I will “diffuse” the “bomb” using multiple methods and multiple tools (hopefully IDA, GDB, EDB, Radare2) to make the most of it and trying to teach something new on the way.<br />


Defending Applications by putting them under the Proactive SOC spotlight <br /> (By: '''Mohamed Alfateh''')<br />

Most companies are trying to shift their Security Operations Center (SOC) from a reactive to a proactive posture. Putting the application layer under a proactive monitoring and analysis is a critical activity to anticipates and pre-empts incidents to prevent their occurrence. In this talk we will discuss different techniques to proactively anticipate web threats and act upon anticipation proactively rather than passively. During the session, we will show how you could use OWASP AppSensor to feed data into SOC and to respond to analysis results. The session will introduce number of corresponding SIEM use cases that could be implemented in deferent SIEM technologies.<br /><br />

PANEL DISCUSSION: WHAT’S NEW WITH OWASP TOP 10 <br /> (By: '''Ahmed Saafan, Hassan Morad, Mohamed Alfateh and Fady Othman''')<br />
OWASP released a major update to the OWASP top 10 project. In this session we will look at what is new in the 2017 version. We will discuss the major changes to the top 10 list and whether or not such changes brings better value to application security.<br /><br />

'''Day 3: Cross Site Scripting '''<br />
XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping, or updates an existing web page with user supplied data using a browser API that can create JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim’s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.<br />

'''Day 5: Security Misconfiguration '''<br />
Good security requires having a secure configuration defined and deployed for the application, frameworks, application server, web server, database server, platform, etc. Secure settings should be defined, implemented, and maintained, as defaults are often insecure. Additionally, software should be kept up to date.<br />

'''Day 6: Sensitive Data Exposure '''<br />
Many web applications and APIs do not properly protect sensitive data, such as financial, healthcare, and PII. Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card fraud, identity theft, or other crimes. Sensitive data deserves extra protection such as encryption at rest or in transit, as well as special precautions when exchanged with the browser.<br />

'''Event Agenda: '''<br />
The Hidden Venom : Dangerous Formats <br /> (By: '''Fady Othman''')<br />

In the past years, we have seen the development of client-side attacks and how hackers became smarter and smarter. We came to a realization that you don't really need a zero day or advanced exploit to spread a malware or ransomware. all what you need is a good social engineering trick and the knowledge of how to abuse a legitimate file format. In this talk, we will have a look at seemingly non-harmful file formats and how they can be abused to spread malware.<br /><br />

Exploiting PHP Serialized Objects for Authentication bypass <br /> (By: '''Ebrahim Hegazy''')<br />
In this session, I will talk about PHP Serialized Objects as following:
1- What is PHP Serialized/Unserialize Objects and how it works, 2- Demo Code on PHP Serialized Objects, 3- Exploitation scenarios for Serialized Objects, 4- Practical example of exploiting Serialized Objects for Authentication bypass & Privilege Escalation.<br /><br />

The Hidden Venom : Detecting APTs at web application layer <br /> (By: '''Mohamed Alfateh''')<br />

Detecting   and   defending   against   Multi - Stage  Advanced  Persistent  Threats  (APT)  Attacks  is a  challenge  for  mechanisms  that   are   static  in   its   nature   and   are based   on  blacklisting  and  malware  signature techniques. The comprehensive analysis and correlation can discover behavior indicative of APT-related attacks and data exfiltration. In the web application layer, other techniques are used to detect the sophisticated web attacks. In this presentation, we will discuss some techniques that could be used to deal with the APTs in the web application layer.<br />

'''Day 1: Injection Day '''<br />
Injection is an entire class of attacks that rely on injecting data into a web application in order to facilitate the execution or interpretation of malicious data in an unexpected manner. Examples of attacks within this class include Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, Header Injection, Log Injection and Full Path Disclosure. I’m scratching the surface here.

This class of attacks is every programmer’s bogeyman. They are the most common and successful attacks on the internet due to their numerous types, large attack surface, and the complexity sometimes needed to protect against them. The injection day includes three sessions covering the Injection Attacks and Mitigations, <br />

'''Location:'''<br />

Mobile Application Security <br /> (By: '''Hassan Elhadary''')<br />

Nowadays web applications are being transformed into mobile applications allowing users to perform security critical functions such as money transfers and bill payments from their mobile devices. Newly added features on mobile applications expose new attack surface for hackers and thus increase the challenges for developers to defend their mobile applications. This talk will focus on latest techniques utilized by attackers to conduct security attacks on mobile applications. It will include real life stories and demos inspired from professional experience and research in bug bounty programs. Finally, recommendations will be outlined to help developers mitigate most common attacks affecting mobile applications.<br /><br />

Application Threat Modeling<br /> (By: '''Mohamed Alfateh''')<br />

According to the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), most successful cyber-attacks result from targeting and exploiting software vulnerabilities. Threat Modeling is a critical activity for identifying such vulnerabilities early in the development stages. In this talk, we will discuss application threat modeling process, how to perform threat modeling in systematic way and how to integrate threat modeling in your software development life-cycle. <br /><br />

Sessions Description 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'''Pwning the skiddies using the anonymity weapon'''<br /> 
Proxy services and vpn servers are used widely all over the world
But , can you really depend on them as secure way to surf the WWW?
We gonna demonstrate how the such services are invisibly used to take over thousands of PCs every single hour.<br />

'''Sleeping your way out of the sandbox''' <br /> 
Recently, a new breed of security solutions appeared in the market, Sandbox based Antimalware solutions, promising to be the answer to advanced malware and APTs.

Yet, as always, there are ways to circumvent any control. In this presentation we will examine a new technique to bypass sandbox based solutions, allowing malware to avoid detection and giving it a free pass to your network.<br />

'''HTML5 security'''<br />
HTML5 was specially designed to deliver rich content without the need for additional plugins. The current version delivers everything from animation to graphics, music to movies, and can also be used to build complicated web applications. Through introducing these new features new vulnerabilities are introduced as well.

This talk will give an introduction about HTML5 and its new features. Then will select a number of examples to demonstrate the positive, and negative impact of these features for web application security.<br />
